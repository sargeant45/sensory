Sensory lighting for Phillips Hue. I made this for a special needs camp and decided I'd share it on GitHub.

## setup
Clone the Git repo and navigate to the directory. Then write the following into your terminal:

```bash
gem install bundler # if you don't have it already
bundle install
```

Then run the Ruby scripts in the `lib` folder.
